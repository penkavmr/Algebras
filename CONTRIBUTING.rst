All new students, please read this before working on this project.


Github

Github is the defacto way of sharing and collaborating on open source
software projects.  If you don't have a github account, get one now.
Github uses git_, which is completely free and compatible with all
operating system.  If you don't have git installed on your computer,
do it now.


Python
======

This project is a rewriting of Maple code to Python code.  In the name
of readablity and accessablity to future contributors, please have a
read of the `python style guide`_.  In particular, please limit line
lengths to 72 characters, use 4 spaces as indentation, and comment
your code as much as possible.


SageMath
========

SageMath_ is highly capable free and open source mathematics software
system.  If you don't have it on your computer, install it now.  You
can also use Sage for free in a web browser at CoCalc_.  If you don't
have a CoCalc account, sign up for one.  Eventually we plan to have
a CoCalc instance running on the BGSC.


Code
====

The new python code is all contained in the */newdefs/* folder.
*ainfdefs.sage* is the new set of function definitions.
*ainfdefs_test.sage* is a series of tests to test the output of the
new functions against the output of the original Maple code.
